I'm a 3rd year PhD student working with my advisor, Joseph Miller in Computability theory, a subfield of Mathematical logic. I'm broadly interested in local and global degree theoritic questions in the Turing and the Enumerations degrees. A current project I'm working on involves characterizing the two halves of an Ahmad pair in the local structure of the Enumeration degrees. I'm also interested in Computable Structure Theory, especially in the degree spectra of structures.

Before my time at Madison, I completed a B.Tech in Computer Science and Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad. I am originally from the beautiful city of Bengaluru and have lived there most of my life. I enjoy reading, cooking, powerlifting, and outdoor time with my dog.
